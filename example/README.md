<PageSection title="Font Awesome Icons">

<v-icon name="book-open" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 1rem;" scale="4" />
You can use font awesome icons. But remember that you need to import the icons that you are using, e.g. in your `.vuepress/enhanceApp.js`:

<<< @/docs/.vuepress/enhanceApp.js{1}

::: section Not included in TOC
By the way: This theme also defines a [custom container](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#custom-containers) that you can use to create the page sections.
But for technical reasons they won't show up in the navigation links.
